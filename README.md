# prework-study-guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage shows an outline of what I have learned so far during the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front End Web Developement and will give the user a hint of what to learn next.

## Usage

Each section of the website cotains some of my notes on certain topics (HTML, CSS, JS and Git).

If the DevTools console is opened a log of topics I have learned is shown and the website will choose one topic to study next.
